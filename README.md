# Dutask
This project aims to create a to-do application that is free, modular, offline, open source and does not collect any unnecessary data.

# The origin of the name
The name comes from the union of the words "duty" and "task", and symbolizes the philosophy that **tasks** to be done should be seen as our **duties** to be completed.

# Why Flutter
I chose Flutter because at the time it was the most production ready multi-platform framework, with the best tooling and with which I had the best feeling.
